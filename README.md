## <ins>What it's about

It's all about me.  If you want to find out a few things about me click the link to open my page and dive in!  You will find a few<br>
  cool projects like moving eyes with a pointer, a mapped bus route and pacman factory along with some of my contact links.
  
## <ins>How to Run

Click the link to open the page then use the navigation bar on top to scroll through the page or just scroll through the page.  Use the <br>
  links to get to my Github, LinkedIn and even download my resume.

## <ins>Future improvements

There are too many future improvements to count.  Adding some animation along with better functionality and placement to make it adapt to <br>
  different screen sizes.  I also downloaded an older version of bootstrap and bootstap.js and was too far in to change it by the time I had realized it
  so finding a clean way to update those is on my list as well.
